                    <p>Vivlio Sagesse, an AI-oriented gadget is aimed to make learning easy for specially-abled people. 
                        While it is mainly aimed to help those with neurological-disorders i.e dyslexic, dysgraphic, 
                        dyscalculic but it also can be utilized by others. <br>
                        To fully understand the function of this gadget, we firstly need to understand what actually are the problems 
         people with neurological-disorders face. <br>They face issues in understanding, text, sounds and fundamental 
                        numerical concepts. Over the years a lot of AI-based tools have been created to help them 
                        learn, but never have they ever been integrated
                        into their daily activities. Let’s take a look at each of these 
                        disorders and how Vivlio Sagesse would help them.

                <div id='goal2txt'>
                    <p>You must have heard that people with dyslexia see words dancing, inverted and have problems navigating 
                        lines which is absolutely NOT TRUE! It is a pure myth. <br>
                        The ‘symptoms of dyslexia’ that you have heard 
                        of are actually symptoms of VPD (Visual processing disorder). These two terms are often confused 
                        because of their co-occurrence i.e. the dyslexic are often found to have VPD, which is more 
                        recognisable than dyslexia. Moreover, dyslexia is a phonological processing disorder. This 
                        means the dyslexic finds problems recognising sounds well. However, it certainly does not mean 
                        that they cannot speak well. They just have problems speaking unfamiliar, long words. For eg. 
                        Unorganised: un+or+gan+i+sed.<br>This device however, can make learning really easy for them by 
                        font-specialisation, customised colour layers and text 
                        to speech.

                <h2 id='Dysgraphia'>Dysgraphia</h2>
                <div id='goal3txt'>
                    <p>There are two categories of this disorder- Language-based dysgraphia and Motor dysgraphia. 
                        Like dyslexia, motor dyslexia involves phonological functioning issues while language-based 
                        does not. However, it does involve low spatial awareness and weak hand coordination. 
	Low spatial awareness causes spacing/shape/size of letters or worthwhile poor hand co-ordination causes inverted/mirror 
                        handwriting. This symptom, we are sure you have heard before but known it as the dyslexic one. 
                        <br>This is because dysgraphia is also often confused with dyslexia and they also frequently co-occur. 
	The dysgraphic also will hugely benefit from this model as it uses text to speech and 
                        visualisation tools.

                <div id='goal4txt'>
                    <p>Dyscalculia is a neurological disorder in which a person has 
                        problems understanding the fundamental mathematical concepts like 
                        money matters,  simple addition, subtraction or problems memorising 
                        tables as easy as that of 2.  <br>Sometimes, it is at such a level that 
                        they are unable to comprehend a thing as simple as that 5 is greater 
                        than 3 or what are numbers!  It also often co-occurs with dyslexia and dysgraphia. 
<br>Visualisation tools such as 3D  or practical explanation of mathematical concepts can 
                        help them build conceptual understanding, which are also integrated in our product.

                 <b>Stylus:</b><br><br>
It is the ‘Input Device’ to help you interact with all the tools. It functions like a normal stylus that helps you scroll, select, change page etc. The stylus is 
                 mainly designed to make certain things such as highlighting easy as finger may cause problems in navigating lines
                 for the dysgraphic etc.

This book is works like tablets but does not affect your eyes like one. This being said, it is also not like Kindles 
                 which use E-ink technology. Vivlio Sagesse uses rear view projection which does not affect your eyes at all. 
	It also has a button/control panel where you can toggle between tools and functions of the stylus.	This book is connected to both the AI 
                 system and the stylus by the tri-bluetooth system, helping you to keep in sync.

                  <b>AI model:</b><br><br>

This is the brain of Vivlio Sagesse, it is fed the data of a class/grade/standard of a said year by inserting a chip. This chip is changeable i.e. after the course’s
                  end you can change the chip which contains all the data of a said course/year.
	This course consists of all the book pdf’s freely available online e.g. NCERT and other books can be 
                  purchased online too which will be added to the data. However, the purchases(only educational tools) 
                  may take place online but the learner would not be able to access the social media 
                  by any other way as it is a great distraction to the learners.
	How will AI work on this data?<br><br>
	
                  <b>1. </b><b>Explanation</b> of any page/phrase/sentence/new or simplification will be purely done by 
                  AI. It enables one to select certain text and provied various options- simplify, explain with example, visual
                  explanation with model, visual practical explanation.
                  <br><br><b>2. </b><b>Text to speech</b> helps them understand how a written word is pronoun
                  ced. They can access this service by a simple select of any word/phrase/pag
                  e on their screens with the help of their stylus and the series of buttons on the book.
                  <br><br><b>3. </b><b>Font-customisation</b> is a useful ser
                  vice for both dysgraphic and dyslexic as different people are comforta
                  ble with different fonts.You just have to click the button ‘Change font’ and voila, you have various font o
                  ptions to choose from on the screen!
The AI will learn with experience about their preferred fonts and also help them get comfort
                  able with other fonts by changing into different fonts.
                  <br><br><b>4. </b>It also gives the dysgraphic <b>writing practice</b> by giving them words
                  to trace in different ways and evaluating their accuracy after every trial. They can access 
                  this feature by selecting the text they want to learn to write and click on the button ‘write’ 
                  The model makes different visual presentations of the selected texts and shows it to the user, then gives it to be traced and then finally to write!
